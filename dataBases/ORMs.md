# Object-relatinal mapping

Context: As part of my Hack4Impact work, I am learning about SQL databases.

Concept: A programming technique to transfer data between a relational 
database (using MySQL in this instance) and heap of an OOP language.

This allows us to use a virtual database to use withing the programming 
language. Will have a better understanding with more use. Will update with more.
